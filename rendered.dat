Es ist 2050 und ganz Berlin ist im Sommer total überhitzt. Ganz Berlin? Nein. Im THF-Gebäude und seinen Innenhöfen, überdachten Plätzen etc gibt es fabelhafte Schattenplätze, wo man sich hinflüchten und sich treffen und entspannen kann. Und es gibt ein "Gesundheits- und Lebenszentrum" für ganzheitliche Klimavorsorge, Erste-Hilfe-Einrichtung für Menschen mit Problemen, Zugang zu leckeren gesunden Getränken,Ärzten etc. Und überall auf dem ganzen THF-Gelände: Schöne und praktische Trinkwasserbrunnen.
